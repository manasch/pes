## Project Description

We are planning on implementing a simple blockchain. Our plan includes simulation and 
visualization of the blockchain. In its essence, blockchain is just a distributed database of 
records, what makes it unique is that itâ€™s not a private database, but a public one. This 
means that everyone who uses it has a full or partial copy of the database.
The user will be able to secure their data on the blockchain by providing the data on the 
GUI.

These are the following features we plan to achieve:
- Creation of a block
- Resolving tiebreakers
- Validating a block (PoW)
- Handling transactions
- Handling block permissions
- Web interface
- Using hashing to maintain the integrity of the blockchain

Future aspect would be to include a blockchain network allowing multiple nodes to interact 
with the same blockchain.

# Task - 1: Agile and Scrum

## Q1.a) Identify from the observations, where all would you think Service Inc. did not meet the intent of the Agile Manifesto

Service Inc. didn’t meet the intent of the Agile Manifesto int the following ways:
- No customer interaction
- Changes were not welcomed later on during development
- No interaction between business people and developers
- Lack of collaborative environment for developers
- No room for retrospection
- Comprehensive documentation prioritized over working software
- Late delivery of working software
- No regular quality checks during development
- Lack of self-organizing teams for development
- No product backlogs/ lack of prioritization

## Q1.b) Identify from the observations, where all would you think Service Inc. deviated from what is expected from a SCRUM implementation

Service Inc. deviated from what is expected from a SCRUM implementation in the
following ways:

- Lacked daily standup meetings.
- Lacked a proper SCRUM structure which consists of various stakeholders
- Had a Hierarchical and bureaucratic management
- Operated on building airtight requirements for their projects
- Tended to freeze the requirements before committing to their resources
- Focused on building extensive documentation
- Inability to adapt to constant changes and uncertainties
- Lacked sprint cycles and corresponding sprint meetings
- Lacked direct communication between junior engineers and higher management
- Lack of transparency in management

## Q1.c) Discuss each of the findings in the table and indicate whether the finding contributed positively or negatively in go/no go recommendation and indicate with _5_ sentences why it is so

- It was observed that scrum masters and product owners were rotated across sprints, which goes against SCRUM ideology.
- It was also observed that project managers were playing the role of scrum masters which is not ideal.
- In sprint meetings, each team member took around 10 minutes. This might have contributed to a “No-go” as daily standups of 60-90 minutes are highly discouraged in any agile methodology.
- Quality engineers joined after 2 weeks of a 4-week sprint. Even though they might have not had anything to work on, all members of a SCRUM team must collaborate and cooperate at regular intervals. This would have contributed to a “No-go”.
- The creation of a new role of SCRUM master would have contributed to a “Go” as this would have increased the effectiveness of SCRUM meetings and now the company has clearly defined roles for following an agile methodology. The introduction of sprint review meetings would have contributed to a “Go”.
- Testing of the product only happened in the last week that only added to their existing backlog that they were already unable to handle.
- Product owners’ lack of communication with customers would have majorly contributed to the overall outcome of “No-go” as this violates the fundamental principles of SCRUM methodology.

## Q2) How can Service Inc. achieve 40% growth in margin while achieving only a 25% growth in revenue?

Service Inc. can achieve the required growth in margin and revenue by following an agile methodology which would in turn improve relationships with Product Inc. as a partner in product roadmap execution. The primary task would be making Product Inc. agree on handing over the execution part of the product line roadmap for growing products on a shared revenue basis.

## Q3) What are the cultural differences between Service Inc. and Product Inc. that you think is a challenge for successful scrum implementation that would satisfy Product Inc.?

Culturally Product Inc. and Service Inc. are poles apart. As an example, in Services Inc. one can make out the seniority of a manager in the organization by the size of his desk and the room that he has been allocated. On the contrary, Product Inc. which has been a customer of Services Inc. for the last 7 years is a flat organization with open offices, where engineers and managers including VPs and SVPs share open cubicles, with the senior managers having offices in corners where engineers do not need to go often, and are designed with dedicated conference rooms for meetings. It can also be noted that Services Inc. did not use Agile while Product Inc. utilizes Scrum methodology.

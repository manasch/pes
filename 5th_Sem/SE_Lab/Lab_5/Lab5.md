## Task 2

1) In line with the four pillars of DevOps – Collaboration, Tools, Scaling and Affinity, your team has to come up with innovative solutions to tackle social issues such as child safety for example (each team is free to choose their own topic based on social issues). This will be done using techniques such as Crazy 4s and S.C.A.M.P.E.R. You are then required to provide a list of tools for an end-to-end technicalsolution for the best idea you generated. You are also required to provide information regarding scaling in terms of teams, Infrastructure, workload, organization and complexity.

	- Crazy 4s:
		1) Open a new text editing document.
		2) Set a timer for four minutes.
		3) In these four minutes each participant is required to come up with four rough ideas as solutions for the problem. You can note your ideas down as small points instead of entire sentences.
		4) At the end of four minutes, you are required to discuss your ideas with your teammates to come up with the best possible solution.
			- NOTE: This can be extended to Crazy 6s or Crazy 8s with six minutes for six ideas or eight minutes for eight ideas depending on team size.

	- S.C.A.M.P.E.R:
	In order to further improve your ideas ideated using Crazy 4s, use this technique. Answer these following questions as a team to improve your idea.
		- Substitute: What can I substitute to make an improvement?
		- Combine: What ideas, features, processes, or components can I combine?
		- Adapt: What processes, features, or components should I adapt?
		- Modify: What can I make larger or make smaller?
		- Put to another use: What else can it be used for? Who else could use it?
		- Eliminate: What would happen if I removed a feature or part of it?
		- Reverse/rearrange: How can we rearrange the current status for an improved solution? What would happen by reversing the process?

## Topic – Health Care

- The ideas that we came up with are:-
	1) Digitization of patient health records and vaccine records to prevent information loss.
	2) Smarter health monitoring hardware/wearables for patient that require constant monitoring to
	ensure timely alert and response in situations requiring immediate expert attention.
	3) Video based consultation for patients for whom travelling is best avoided or is not possible. Therefore, making it easier to get access to medical advice from experts.


- S.C.A.M.P.E.R

	- Substitute – Replace current hardware with smarter location tracking hardware/wearables to give location of patient in case of medical emergencies
	- Combine – We can combine these hardware/wearables with digital consultations to help doctors track patient’s vitals such as pulse, blood pressure etc.
	- Adapt – Adopt a unified repository of health record of patient to prevent accidental loss of information
	- Modify – We can make health/vital monitoring systems smaller and more compact for extended continuous monitoring for patients visiting out-patient departments.
	- Put to another use – We can add more functionality to hardware/wearables to monitor various health metrics. Possibility to diversify wearables to be put to use in the veterinary department.
	- Eliminate – We could remove/bench robotic surgeries/AI in highly complex and sensitive medical procedures till they are tested for very accurate results.
	- Reverse/Re-arrange – Medical companies can invest in software department to create inhouse software solutions for more security and easier access. Reversing digitization of health records can lead to an increased risk of information loss.

Involved setting up a VM and installing hadoop which will be used for all further classes.

Was told to refer to the following links for installation, verification and running tasks.

- [Assignment 0 [A0]](https://github.com/Cloud-Computing-Big-Data/UE20CS322-A0)
- [Hands On 1 [H1]](https://github.com/Cloud-Computing-Big-Data/UE20CS322-H1)

H1 had two parts, HOME and CLASS, both of which are mentioned in the same link.

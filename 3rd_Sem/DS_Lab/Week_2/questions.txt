TOPIC : SINGLY LINKED LIST

1. Implement the following operations on singly linked list (5 + 5Marks)

(ii) Swap 2 nodes without swapping the data.
(iii) Delete every alternate node starting from the first node

2. Perform the addition of 2 polynomials stored as a Singly linked list. Structure of a polynomial
nodes is as follows:(20 Marks)
struct poly{
int coeff;
int px;// power of x
int py;// power of y
struct node *next;// pointer to hold address of next node.
}
Ex : first polynomial-> 3x^2 y^2 + 2xy^2 + 3xy
second polynomial -> 4x^2 y^2 +3x^2 y+6xy
resultant polynomial-> 7x^2 y^2 + 2xy^2 + 3x^2 y + 9xy
